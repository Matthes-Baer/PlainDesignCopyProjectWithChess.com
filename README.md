# Project: <a href="https://matthes-baer.github.io/PlainDesignCopyProjectWithChess.com/" target="_blank">No Framework</a>
This project marks my very first published web development endeavor, where I aimed to emulate the design of https://www.chess.com/. While it's an approximation, I strived to recreate the essence of the original website's layout and aesthetics.

## About the Project üîé
For this project, I deliberately chose not to utilize any form of framework as I wanted to challenge myself with a raw approach and leverage my frontend knowledge to discover fitting and innovative solutions.

Since I refrained from copying any code through the console, some measurements may not precisely match those of the original website. Similarly, the larger pictures are mere screenshots, resulting in slightly different dimensions. However, the main objective wasn't to create an exact replica, but rather to employ the chess.com landing page as a design guide and showcase my proficiency in providing the necessary pure HTML and CSS skills to craft a visually similar landing page.

Additionally, I incorporated a touch of JavaScript into the main chessboard at the top. Instead of using a static image, I created a dynamic grid with possible starting moves for the pawns and knights. Moreover, I implemented a small random number generator for the "Games Today" and "Playing Now" categories at the top.

For the project's elements, including icons, I have credited the sources in the footer.

## Additional Information ‚ùó
- Please note that the responsive design of my project may differ significantly from the original chess.com webpage.
- Kindly be aware that the original design of chess.com has undergone recent changes, particularly in the navigation bar, which occurred after the completion of this project.
- Some images were captured through screenshots to preserve the actual state of the original website. However, due to this process, especially the quality of the chessboard picture screenshots might be compromised.
