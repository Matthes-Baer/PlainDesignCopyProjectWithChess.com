# Description
This project is an approach to **approximately** copy the design of https://www.chess.com/.

For the editing I didn't use any CSS framework. It was intended to be a first frontend challenge for which I had to work with my CSS knowledge in order to find fitting similar solutions instead of quickly achieving results using Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS for example.

**Please also be aware that the original design has recently changed (especially at the navgiation bar) after I completed this project.**

## Distinctions from the original
Due to the fact that I didn't copy any code through the console, some measurements are not identical with the ones from the original website (https://www.chess.com/) - same for the larger pictures which are just screenshots (and therefore don't have identical measurements as well). 
The goal was not to create an exact copy but to use the chess.com landing page as design guide in order to see if I am able to provide the required pure HTML and CSS skills for a landing page which looks somewhat similar.

In addition, I added some little JavaScript code to the main chessboard on the top (instead of an pure image I decided to work with a grid and added possible starting moves for the pawns as well as for the knights). I also made use of a small random Number generator for the "Games Today" and "Playing Now" categories at the top. Besides that, especially the responsive design has major differences in contrast to the original chess.com web page. 

The used sources (especially icons) can be found in the footer:

**Some pictures were made through screenshots. Due to this process especially the chessboard picture screenshots are lacking in quality.**
